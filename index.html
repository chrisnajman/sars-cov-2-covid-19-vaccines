            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              This page outlines the pathways of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and of the
              two most widely used vaccines against Covid-19 (the disease caused
              by the virus). 
            </p>
            <h3>MHC1 cell receptors and the immune response</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Special receptors (MHC1s) are present on the surface of every
                cell.
              </li>
              <li>
                Fragments of all proteins produced inside the cell, benevolent
                or otherwise, will be displayed on these MHC1 receptors.
              </li>
              <li>
                These fragments will be presented to cells of the immune system.
              </li>
              <li>
                The immune system will memorise the characteristics of the
                protein, and attempt to neutralise or destroy the pathogen
                wherever and whenever it is encountered.
              </li>
            </ol>

              Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
              carries single-stranded positive sense RNA (+RNA) as its genomic
              material
              <a href="#note1"><sup id="ref1">[1]</sup></a
              >. To gain access to a cell and deposit the viral RNA, a virion
              attaches itself to the cell by binding the viral spike (S) protein
              to a specific cell receptor (ACE2).
            </p>

            <p>
              The viral RNA and the spike (S) protein which will be translated
              from it are the most important ingredients of the vaccines.

            <h2>Vaccines</h2>
            <p>
              The objective of any Covid-19 vaccine is to deliver a modified
              version of the SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA to ribosomes in the host
              cell. This modified version only contains the genes for making the
              S protein &mdash; the ribosomes do the job of translating them.
              <em>It must be stressed that the S protein is not infectious</em>
              and is merely used as a marker for the immune system to identify.
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently, the two most widely accepted vaccines for international
              travel
              <a href="#note2"><sup id="ref2">[2]</sup></a> are those produced
              by AstraZeneca/Oxford and Pfizer/BioNTech. It will be seen from
              the diagrams that the methods of translation, assembly and budding
              of the S proteins are the same for both vaccines. The major
              difference between them is that the Pfizer/BioNTech carries RNA
              and the Astrazeneca vaccine carries DNA. The Astrazenaca DNA must
              be injected into the nucleus and converted (transcribed) to mRNA
              before proteins can be translated, whereas the RNA carried by
              Pfizer/BioNTech can start translation as soon as it escapes from
              the endosome.
            </p>

              <p>
                This vaccines employs a harmless, engineered chimpanzee
                adenovirus as its vector.
              </p>
              <h4>How is it harmless?</h4>
              <p>
                All infectious genes are stripped from the DNA during the
                production process with the result that it cannot be used to
                replicate neither adenoviruses (as there are no longer any genes
                that can encode this in the DNA) nor SARS-CoV-2 proteins
                (excepting the S protein, the only protein the genes in the DNA
                can encode for).
              </p>
              <h4>Why a chimpanzee adenovirus?</h4>
              <p>
                Adenoviruses, which cause cold-like symptoms, routinely infect
                humans. Consequently, the immune system has many defences
                against them. Using a human adenovirus as a vector for a vaccine
                would therefore mean that there would be a strong chance of it
                being destroyed before it was able to enter a cell, rendering
                the vaccine useless. Using a chimpanzee adenovirus, unknown to
                the immune system, provides a much greater chance of the vaccine
                being able to enter a cell and do its work.
              </p>
              <h4>How is it engineered?</h4>
              <p>
                All adenoviruses carry DNA as the genomic material. The viral
                RNA from SARS-CoV-2 is first extracted and then reverse
                transcribed <a href="#note3"><sup id="ref3">[3]</sup></a> back
                into DNA. This DNA then replaces the adenovirus DNA, after, as previously mentioned,
                all genes save those that encode for the S protein have been removed.</p>
<h4>Viral DNA and the host cell nucleus</h4>
                <p>It is important to emphasise that although the DNA will eventually be inserted into a host cell's nucleus <strong>it will not integrate with the host cell's DNA</strong>.</p>

            <h2>The Role of Adjuvants in Vaccines</h2>
            <p>
              Adjuvants (not shown in the diagrams) <a href="#note5"><sup id="ref5">[5]</sup></a> are substances in the vaccines which stimulate
              cell-mediated immune responses.
            </p>
            <p>
              Adjuvants require something of a balancing act: they need to
              induce a strong immune response which will attract the attention of cells 
              from the innate immune system. However, 
              the response must not be so strong that 
              the cell is destroyed (or self-destructs) before the
              protein fragment on the MHC1 receptor is stored and analysed by the adaptive immune
              system.
